                        <h3>Research in AI/ML - Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Conducted a research project focused on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy in social media posts. The project involved collecting a large dataset of tweets and user reviews, preprocessing the text data through tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, and applying advanced machine learning algorithms, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer models like BERT. Implemented custom feature engineering to capture context-specific nuances, significantly improving the model's ability to detect subtle sentiments. The research resulted in a sentiment analysis tool with an accuracy rate of over 90%, aiding businesses in real-time sentiment tracking and decision-making processes, ultimately leading to improved customer engagement and satisfaction.
